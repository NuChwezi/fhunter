FORTUNE HUNTER
==============

A fun and enlightening expedition for those that wish to mine Unix Fortune Cookies!


What it IS
-----------

[Unix Fortune Cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix) have been around since you know when, and we all love cookies and lots of fortune (especially in the middle of insanely buggy projects). 

Fortune Hunter is the Game that gives you the opportunity to attack from the other side of the frenemy line; divert that immense and overflowing stress (or just chaos) away from your project manager(s) and nagging folks, and get down to some serious and funky fortune mining and hunting! With every fortune comes more reward and enlightenment!

Credit Where It's Due
---------------------

Am not a 3D ninja nor your GL guru, but I love when I see a swanky concept that is being under-utilized, and is begging for proper re-application or extension. This game wouldn't be possible without the stealing I did from the ideas of [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), and especially the [freaky periodic table](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/css3d_periodictable.html)!

Thanks to those true hackers!
